# Doughmination System Server

This is a personal project built for our own system's use — a lightweight frontend that interfaces with the Pluralkit API to display our system members, current fronters, and individual member profiles in a clean and simple way. It includes a light/dark mode toggle and minimal UI for clarity.

## This is for:

- Displaying our own Pluralkit system members in a user-friendly interface
- Showing who’s fronting, with automatic favicon and title updates
- Viewing individual member details like pronouns and descriptions
- Switching between dark and light themes depending on vibes

## Notes:

This is a personalized project. It’s open-source in case others who are familiar with Pluralkit and self-hosting want to use or adapt it — but it’s not built to be a plug-and-play solution or official tool.

If you know what you’re doing and want to tweak it for your own system, feel free to fork it!

Made with ✨ by and for our system.
